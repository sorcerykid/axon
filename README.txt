Axon Event Propagation Mod v1.0
By Leslie E. Krause

Axon is a lightweight but powerful event propagation framework for Minetest, affording a 
new degree of creative freedom for game designers and mod developers. It is inspired in
great part by the Act/React system of the Dark Engine by Looking Glass Studios.
